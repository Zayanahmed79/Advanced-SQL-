# 🧠 Advanced SQL Series – Alex The Analyst (YouTube)

This repository contains my personal practice, notes, and exercises based on the **Advanced SQL Series** by [Alex The Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexTheAnalyst). It includes advanced querying techniques and best practices for working with large, complex datasets in MySQL.

📌 **Disclaimer**:  
This is *not* an official course repo. The content is based on what I learned from Alex The Analyst's tutorials but **written and practiced entirely by me**. No original content from Alex's course has been copied or distributed.
